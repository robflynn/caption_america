Our planet is
the greatest living puzzle

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.717 align:start line:10% position:30% size:40%
in the universe,

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:21.287 align:start line:10% position:23% size:55%
a collection of worlds
within worlds,

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:25.091 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
each one a network
of relationships and connections

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.827 align:start line:10% position:20% size:58%
between
all their living parts,

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:31.464 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
leading to the diverse
and complex world we live in.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.602 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
And at the heart
of many of these worlds

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.805 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
is a very special group
of animals--

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.308 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
the insects,
and their close relatives,

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:45.044 align:start line:79% position:30% size:40%
the arachnids
and crustaceans,

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:48.114 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
classed together
as the arthropods.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.786 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
Together they account
for 80% of all animal species

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.721 align:start line:85% position:33% size:35%
on our planet.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.557 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
In these three specials,
we're going to explore

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.859 align:start line:79% position:28% size:43%
the connections
and relationships

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.895 align:start line:85% position:20% size:58%
that they have with us,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.464 align:start line:85% position:35% size:28%
our planet,

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.167 align:start line:10% position:25% size:50%
and with each other,

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.303 align:start line:10% position:20% size:60%
ultimately to understand
how this group

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:12.939 align:start line:10% position:15% size:68%
hold the key to life itself

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.609 align:start line:10% position:13% size:75%
inside "Nature's Microworlds."

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:26.286 align:start line:10% position:28% size:43%
Arthropods are
the most abundant

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.055 align:start line:10% position:20% size:60%
and diverse group
of animals in the world.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.693 align:start line:10% position:15% size:70%
They inhabit every continent

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:35.261 align:start line:10% position:28% size:45%
and every ocean...

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:42.001 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
from the harsh climate
of Antarctica

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.638 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
to the driest of deserts
around the equator,

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:50.043 align:start line:85% position:20% size:60%
from the lushest jungles

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.512 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
to the highest mountain peaks.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:01.554 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
There are an estimated
10 million species,

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:07.193 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
more than all the other
animal groups combined.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.866 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
But what is the secret
of their success?

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.704 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
What is the single key
to their global domination?

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.676 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
To understand this,
we need to unpick one by one

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.880 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
the factors that influence
the lives of arthropods.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.387 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
First we need to understand
what arthropods are

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:36.256 align:start line:85% position:18% size:63%
and where they came from.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:43.897 align:start line:10% position:13% size:75%
And to do that, we must travel
to Delaware Bay

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:46.065 align:start line:10% position:13% size:73%
on the East Coast of America.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.141 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
Four hundred million
years ago,

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:58.912 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
the first land animals pulled
themselves out of the sea.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:04.684 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
They were the ancestors
of the arthropods

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.786 align:start line:79% position:28% size:43%
who dominate
our planet today.

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.427 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
And each spring
on the highest tides

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:16.396 align:start line:85% position:18% size:65%
of the full and new moons,

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.932 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
a similar spectacle
still occurs.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.504 align:start line:85% position:18% size:65%
These are horseshoe crabs,

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:27.674 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
some of the most primitive
arthropods alive today.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:31.277 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
They're here to breed.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:37.050 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
The males are two-thirds
the size of their mates

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.185 align:start line:79% position:28% size:43%
and cluster along
the water's edge

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.187 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
as the females arrive.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.726 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
Clinging to the female's shell,
he's pulled up the beach,

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.262 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
fertilizing her eggs
as she lays.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:01.741 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
For these crabs, breeding
on land is only possible

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.544 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
because
of the arthropod blueprint.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.482 align:start line:85% position:38% size:23%
[zapping]

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:15.622 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
Their basic body plan
is the same as all arthropods--

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.523 align:start line:85% position:25% size:48%
a hard exoskeleton,

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:21.561 align:start line:85% position:30% size:38%
segmented body,

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.296 align:start line:85% position:28% size:43%
and jointed legs,

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.534 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
a body plan
that's persisted unchanged

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.671 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
for 400 million years;

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:35.074 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
a body plan as adaptable
as it is simple.

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:41.814 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
The key design feature
is no doubt the exoskeleton.

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.886 align:start line:85% position:18% size:63%
A hard external skeleton,

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:50.857 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
largely made of chitin,
that provides protection,

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:54.827 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
support for muscles,
but most importantly,

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:57.096 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
prevents water loss
from the body.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.469 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
The ability of the exoskeleton
to retain water

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.039 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
is the factor
that allows these crabs

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.141 align:start line:85% position:18% size:63%
to lay their eggs on land

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.143 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
and ultimately
allowed arthropods

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:13.379 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
to be the first animals
to colonize the land.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:20.820 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
But even this master
of design, the exoskeleton,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.488 align:start line:85% position:30% size:38%
has a weakness.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.660 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
How do you grow
inside a suit of armor?

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:38.571 align:start line:10% position:15% size:68%
To see that, we must travel
400 miles south

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:41.774 align:start line:10% position:18% size:65%
to a freshwater microworld
in South Carolina.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:59.659 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
This crayfish is getting ready
to transform,

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.663 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
something all arthropods
must do to increase their size.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.338 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
In preparation, he withdraws
calcium from his shell

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:14.707 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
and stores it
in little white tablets

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:17.643 align:start line:85% position:20% size:60%
on the side of his head.

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:21.180 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
His hard exoskeleton
then splits

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.051 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
and the larger,
soft-bodied crayfish emerges.

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.089 align:start line:85% position:15% size:70%
It can take up to a few days

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.592 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
for the new exoskeleton
to fully harden,

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:36.129 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
and before this occurs,
the crayfish is vulnerable.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:45.338 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
This queen snake is
on a hunt for a meal.

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:50.343 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
The hardened armor
of the crayfish

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:53.012 align:start line:85% position:25% size:50%
is too much for her,

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:55.481 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
but she can detect
the chemicals given off

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:58.985 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
by the soft body
of a freshly molted crayfish

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:01.921 align:start line:85% position:13% size:73%
and knows this is her chance.

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.037 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
As soft as a doughnut,

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:20.907 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
this crayfish
provides a hearty meal.

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:30.082 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
So the exoskeleton,
vital to their success,

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.418 align:start line:85% position:15% size:70%
also leaves them vulnerable.

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:39.258 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
And it has another
significant defining effect

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start line:85% position:25% size:48%
on all arthropods--

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.631 align:start line:85% position:20% size:60%
it restricts their size.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.374 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
This is the largest
terrestrial arthropod,

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:56.909 align:start line:85% position:28% size:43%
the coconut crab.

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:03.049 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
This crab will molt each year
and can live until he's 60,

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:06.452 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
yet is still no larger
than a newborn baby.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.657 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
If you must transform
every time you need to grow,

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.527 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
then there's a limit
to how big you can get.

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:19.332 align:start line:79% position:28% size:43%
But this apparent
size disadvantage

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.634 align:start line:85% position:20% size:60%
can be seen as an asset.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:27.707 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
It opens up a whole new world
for the arthropods.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.652 align:start line:10% position:30% size:38%
And to see how,
we must travel

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:42.021 align:start line:10% position:25% size:48%
to the Flow Country
in Scotland.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.967 align:start line:85% position:20% size:58%
This is the fairy wasp,

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:56.936 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
a quarter
of a millimeter long.

00:08:56.936 --> 00:09:00.339 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
They spend nearly
all their lives underwater.

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:05.311 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
She is one of the smallest
known arthropods

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:09.448 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
alive on the planet and almost
invisible to the naked eye.

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:13.386 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
She makes a tiny water flea
look like a giant.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:17.790 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
This female is looking
for a very specific place

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.392 align:start line:85% position:30% size:40%
to lay her eggs.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.896 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
She positions
her microscopic ovipositor

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.365 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
to pierce into the stem
of a plant

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:29.602 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
where the eggs of a water beetle
have been laid.

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:35.841 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
She deposits up to 100 eggs
inside a single beetle egg.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.348 align:start line:85% position:23% size:53%
When the young hatch,

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.450 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
they have a ready source
of food--

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
the water beetle's
undeveloped young.

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:52.491 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
It's only the size
of this wasp

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:55.861 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
that opens up this niche
for her to exploit.

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:01.801 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
In fact, the arthropods'
diminutive size

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:06.172 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
gives them a real trump card
in the game of life.

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:10.176 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
It allows them to exploit
microhabitats,

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:14.647 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
be it an egg,
a gall on an oak tree,

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.482 align:start line:85% position:28% size:43%
or a single leaf.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:21.153 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
The wealth of habitats
and niches available to them

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:23.122 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
is virtually infinite.

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:31.197 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
But being small
also makes them vulnerable.

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:38.004 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
Their size and abundance
makes them an ideal food source

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:40.473 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
for a whole host
of other animals...

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:49.815 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
including the biggest animal
to have ever lived...

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.553 align:start line:85% position:30% size:38%
the blue whale.

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:02.094 align:start line:79% position:28% size:43%
So if size is not
the ultimate key

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:04.864 align:start line:85% position:28% size:43%
to their success,

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:06.732 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
we must look elsewhere

00:11:06.732 --> 00:11:09.201 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
and examine why the diversity
of arthropods

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:13.606 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
has evolved so much faster
than in all other animal groups.

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:19.845 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
How do the arthropods
speed up their evolution?

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:26.585 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
To find out, we must travel
to a microworld

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:29.221 align:start line:85% position:13% size:73%
in our very own back gardens.

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:36.429 align:start line:79% position:30% size:40%
This is a female
cabbage aphid.

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:43.369 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
In spring she produces
100 offspring in just a week.

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:48.541 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
Her offspring already
have babies inside them,

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.944 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
so this mother aphid
is nurturing her granddaughters

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.913 align:start line:85% position:18% size:63%
even before they're born.

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:58.951 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
If all her descendants
survived and bred,

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:00.453 align:start line:85% position:20% size:60%
by the end of the summer

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:06.158 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
there'd be
1,560 billion trillion aphids.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:12.098 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
She is the ultimate
breeding machine.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.603 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
This ability to reproduce
prolifically

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:20.239 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
is a real trait
of the arthropods.

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:26.946 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
Having lots of offspring
and a quick lifecycle

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:30.416 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
increases the chances
of genetic mutations occurring.

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.553 align:start line:85% position:18% size:63%
And it's these mutations,

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:38.190 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
however bizarre they seem,
that increase the diversity

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.725 align:start line:85% position:28% size:43%
of the gene pool.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.663 align:start line:79% position:30% size:40%
They can provide
novel solutions

00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:46.365 align:start line:85% position:20% size:58%
to life's challenges...

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.677 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
and ultimately lead to
the evolution of new species.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.816 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
This means that arthropods
have the ability

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:07.520 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
to respond to opportunities
and potentially fill niches

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.189 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
faster than any other group
of animals.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.893 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
This does gives them
a winning hand

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:17.029 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
and provides another
vital piece in our jigsaw.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.769 align:start line:85% position:13% size:73%
But it's not the whole story.

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.545 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
We've seen how arthropods
have been around

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start line:85% position:15% size:68%
for over 400 million years,

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:39.752 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
how their winning body plan
has stood them in good stead

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start line:85% position:28% size:45%
for all this time.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.892 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
We've seen how their size
enables them

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.527 align:start line:85% position:18% size:63%
to exploit microhabitats,

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:52.431 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
and rapid reproduction has
accelerated their evolution--

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:58.037 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
all factors
that have enabled them to fly,

00:13:58.037 --> 00:14:02.107 align:start line:85% position:15% size:68%
squelch, crawl, and scuttle

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:05.177 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
into the myriad of forms
we see today.

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.749 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
But there's a twist
in the tale.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:17.223 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
For the real key to their
global success and diversity,

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:19.858 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
we must look
much closer to home.

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:26.265 align:start line:10% position:10% size:80%
To really understand
the diversity of the arthropods,

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.100 align:start line:10% position:25% size:48%
we must examine how
the presence

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.302 align:start line:10% position:25% size:48%
of other arthropods
affects them.

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:36.609 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
Firstly, let's look
at what can be achieved

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:39.211 align:start line:79% position:30% size:38%
when arthropods
work together.

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:46.085 align:start line:85% position:38% size:23%
[buzzing]

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:55.027 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
This colony of 40,000 bees
is focused on a single task--

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:57.329 align:start line:85% position:20% size:60%
the production of honey.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:05.104 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
They have a single queen
who is the only bee to lay eggs.

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:09.108 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
She can lay up to 2,000
in a single day.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.314 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
Each bee is roughly
1.5 centimeters in length.

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:18.417 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
Their exoskeleton prevents them
from growing any further

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.219 align:start line:85% position:25% size:48%
in this adult form.

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:25.524 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
But there's an animal
over a million times its weight

00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:26.825 align:start line:85% position:33% size:33%
on the prowl,

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:31.730 align:start line:85% position:15% size:68%
and<i> he's</i> after their honey.

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:38.604 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
To lose their honey now
would be fatal

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.472 align:start line:85% position:28% size:43%
for their colony.

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.474 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
It'll be their only source
of food

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:45.144 align:start line:85% position:13% size:75%
during the cold winter months.

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:49.114 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
But this super society
won't give up its hard-won prize

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.516 align:start line:85% position:30% size:40%
without a fight.

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:56.689 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
They attack
and sting en masse.

00:15:56.689 --> 00:16:00.125 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
The first stinger
releases an alarm pheromone

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:03.395 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
that tells other bees
to join in.

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:04.897 align:start line:85% position:23% size:53%
The stings are barbed

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:07.366 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
and hook into the skin
of the bear.

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:17.409 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
Each sting has its own
nervous system

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:19.678 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
and pumps venom
into the attacker.

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:27.753 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
Worker bees
can only sting once

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:29.588 align:start line:85% position:28% size:45%
and then they die.

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:34.159 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
It's the ultimate sacrifice
for their colony.

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:38.697 align:start line:85% position:15% size:70%
But the bees are victorious.

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:41.066 align:start line:85% position:23% size:53%
The bear is repelled.

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:47.606 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
Teamwork enables these bees
to defend their precious honey

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:50.509 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
against an intruder
many thousands of times

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.144 align:start line:85% position:30% size:38%
their own size.

00:16:55.914 --> 00:17:00.119 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
So working together can offer
great advantages for defense.

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.489 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
But it's one thing
if your attacker

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:05.557 align:start line:79% position:28% size:43%
is an animal
like a black bear

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:09.128 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
and quite another
if it's the environment itself.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.870 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
So how does working as a team
allow you to live

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.073 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
in one of the toughest
environments in the world?

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.811 align:start line:10% position:18% size:65%
To find out,
we must travel 9,000 miles

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:27.946 align:start line:10% position:30% size:40%
to the mangroves
of Australia.

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:33.452 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
They may look like
a benign place to live,

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start line:85% position:15% size:68%
but they're actually packed

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.723 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
with potentially deadly
natural forces--

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:45.330 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
hot tropical sun, salty water,
and the risk of drowning

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.065 align:start line:85% position:23% size:53%
with every high tide.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.207 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
But in the mangrove mud
is where these ants have chosen

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:57.543 align:start line:85% position:25% size:50%
to build their nest.

00:17:57.543 --> 00:18:02.147 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
And teamwork has turned
the tide to their advantage.

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:07.252 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
Each high tide brings
a fresh bounty of food

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:09.221 align:start line:85% position:18% size:65%
that the ants can harvest.

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:15.394 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
But this tide also brings
the threat of drowning

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:19.364 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
and the precious ant larvae
being swept away.

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:22.100 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
The ants have
a cunning strategy.

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:36.915 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
Every tide, these ants
combine their forces

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:40.118 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
and move the entire nest,
larvae and all,

00:18:40.118 --> 00:18:42.588 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
into bell-shaped chambers
they've built

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:44.089 align:start line:85% position:25% size:48%
which trap the air,

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:47.759 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
keeping them safely
above the waterline.

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:49.795 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
Here they'll remain
for several hours

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.697 align:start line:85% position:20% size:60%
until the tide retreats.

00:18:58.003 --> 00:19:02.908 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
So cooperation between
arthropods of the same species

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.843 align:start line:85% position:20% size:60%
offers great advantages.

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:11.817 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
But we must look elsewhere
for the ultimate key

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:14.119 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
to the success
of the arthropods.

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:19.291 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
We must examine the idea
that diversity stems

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:23.795 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
not only from cooperation
but also exploitation.

00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:31.870 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
A female bolas spider.

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:34.973 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
She's hunting for food

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:40.479 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
and she's got
a pretty unique way of doing it.

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:46.118 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
She spins a single thread
of silk,

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:47.853 align:start line:85% position:18% size:65%
thinner than a human hair,

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.322 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
with a sticky globule
on the end.

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.093 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
And from special glands
on her abdomen,

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:58.096 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
she produces a pheromone
to attract her prey.

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:03.201 align:start line:85% position:38% size:25%
She waits.

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:08.140 align:start line:85% position:25% size:50%
An approaching moth,

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.276 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
but she hasn't quite
got her eye in.

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:19.985 align:start line:85% position:20% size:58%
She doesn't miss twice.

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:30.062 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
So arthropods affect
their own diversity

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:32.030 align:start line:85% position:15% size:68%
by providing a food source.

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.835 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
And necessity being
the mother of all invention,

00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:39.871 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
they've evolved
some diverse and ingenious ways

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:41.406 align:start line:85% position:20% size:58%
of catching each other.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:49.815 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
But the exploitative
relationships between them

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:51.717 align:start line:85% position:30% size:40%
don't end there.

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:58.490 align:start line:79% position:28% size:43%
The Mojave Desert
in California.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.892 align:start line:79% position:30% size:40%
This is a female
blister beetle.

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:07.699 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
She lays her eggs
in the scorching sand

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:10.769 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
of the desert a few
centimeters below the surface--

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:16.108 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
the perfect temperature
for incubation.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.976 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
When the larvae hatch,

00:21:17.976 --> 00:21:21.213 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
they need to find food,
and fast.

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:26.551 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
En masse, they climb
the nearest stem of grass

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:28.153 align:start line:85% position:25% size:48%
and form a cluster.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.959 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
They release a pheromone
identical to that produced

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.861 align:start line:85% position:20% size:58%
by a female digger bee,

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:38.363 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
and it isn't long
before they're noticed.

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:45.404 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
This is a male digger bee,
and he's come to mate,

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:47.706 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
but instead
of an amorous reception,

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:50.609 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
he's boarded by hundreds
of larvae.

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:55.747 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
Temporarily stunned,
he falls to the floor,

00:21:55.747 --> 00:21:58.850 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
but quickly regains
his composure

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.920 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
and heads off in search
of another female.

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:08.527 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
While he's mating,
his stowaways jump ship.

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:18.336 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
The female then returns
to her burrow

00:22:18.336 --> 00:22:21.540 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
where she's secreted pollen
for her un-hatched young.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:29.981 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
The blister beetle's larvae
have reached safety

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:33.018 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
and a ready supply
of food,

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:35.153 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
and when the pollen
is finished,

00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:38.156 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
they'll consume the young
of the digger bee.

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:44.763 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
So we know that predation
and exploitation

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:46.298 align:start line:85% position:28% size:45%
lead to diversity.

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:53.171 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
But there's one final factor
that affects the success

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:55.006 align:start line:85% position:28% size:45%
of the arthropods,

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:57.342 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
one final vital key
that unlocks

00:22:57.342 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
a greater understanding
of their world,

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:03.448 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
and without which
the array of life we see today

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:06.451 align:start line:85% position:23% size:53%
would not be present,

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start line:85% position:18% size:65%
and it's diversity itself.

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:26.104 align:start line:85% position:15% size:68%
Diversity breeds diversity.

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:30.342 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
Arthropods are part
of a constant arms race

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:33.478 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
to outmaneuver
and exploit each other,

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:36.047 align:start line:79% position:30% size:40%
a process called
co-evolution.

00:23:37.415 --> 00:23:40.385 align:start line:10% position:15% size:70%
To see co-evolution at work,
we must head to a meadow

00:23:40.385 --> 00:23:42.154 align:start line:10% position:28% size:45%
in the Swiss Alps.

00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:50.529 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
This is a female
Alcon blue butterfly.

00:23:53.532 --> 00:23:56.234 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
She lays her eggs
on the gentian plant,

00:23:56.234 --> 00:23:58.069 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
and when they've hatched
into caterpillars

00:23:58.069 --> 00:24:01.506 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
and eaten their fill,
they drop onto the ground.

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:05.343 align:start line:85% position:15% size:70%
Surrounded by foraging ants,

00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:07.712 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
you'd think they'd be
at risk,

00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:09.948 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
but the ants
dutifully collect them

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.484 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
and transport them back
to their nest

00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:14.986 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
where they're cleaned
and fed.

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:23.695 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
The Alcon blue caterpillars
have bewitched the ants.

00:24:25.163 --> 00:24:27.365 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
They emit chemicals
that convince the ants

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:29.634 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
they're one
of their own larvae,

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:32.537 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
even producing noises
similar to those made

00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:35.907 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
by the queen ant
to ensure the royal treatment.

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:41.213 align:start line:79% position:23% size:55%
They've checked in
to a 5-star ant hotel.

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:47.285 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
But the ingenuity
of this butterfly species

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:50.222 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
presents an opportunity
to any other species

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:52.424 align:start line:79% position:33% size:35%
canny enough
to exploit it.

00:24:57.596 --> 00:25:00.131 align:start line:85% position:18% size:63%
This is a ichneumon wasp.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.037 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
Out of hundreds of ants' nests,
she's able to detect the one

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:09.174 align:start line:79% position:10% size:78%
that contains
an Alcon butterfly caterpillar.

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:17.048 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
The ants' response
to any invader is to attack,

00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:23.154 align:start line:79% position:15% size:70%
but<i> she</i> releases a pheromone
that deranges the ants.

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:27.626 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
They begin to attack
each other.

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:33.265 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
And this buys her
the time she needs.

00:25:39.237 --> 00:25:42.574 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
The wasp makes a beeline
for the butterfly larvae

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.776 align:start line:85% position:15% size:70%
where she will lay her eggs.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.490 align:start line:79% position:25% size:50%
Job complete,
she leaves the nest.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.030 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
The ants' nest,
released from the wasps spell,

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.665 align:start line:85% position:28% size:45%
returns to normal.

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:15.774 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
The caterpillars remain
in the nest

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:19.411 align:start line:79% position:10% size:80%
until the following summer
when they transform into a pupa,

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:21.246 align:start line:85% position:20% size:60%
and after about a month,

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.481 align:start line:79% position:23% size:53%
the adult butterflies
emerge.

00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:37.462 align:start line:79% position:15% size:68%
But not every pupa contains
an Alcon blue adult.

00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:41.900 align:start line:85% position:20% size:58%
A young ichneumon wasp.

00:26:53.745 --> 00:26:57.549 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
The exploiter
has become the exploited.

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:06.057 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
Diversity has presented
opportunity.

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:13.598 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
The wasp has evolved
to exploit the butterfly,

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:17.769 align:start line:85% position:23% size:55%
who exploits the ants.

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:21.272 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
Their lives are
intricately linked.

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:23.441 align:start line:85% position:23% size:53%
They have co-evolved.

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:29.047 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
And this is the final,
vital key to the abundance

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:31.950 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
and diversity
of the arthropods--

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.786 align:start line:85% position:15% size:70%
the process of co-evolution.

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:38.490 align:start line:79% position:25% size:48%
All over the world,
the opportunities

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.027 align:start line:79% position:13% size:73%
presented by other arthropods
are creating the pressure

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:44.262 align:start line:85% position:20% size:58%
to innovate and evolve.

00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:48.400 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
No doubt this diversity
wouldn't exist

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.304 align:start line:79% position:13% size:75%
if it weren't for that
winning body plan, small size,

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start line:85% position:23% size:53%
ability to reproduce,

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.842 align:start line:85% position:25% size:48%
work cooperatively,

00:27:57.842 --> 00:28:01.446 align:start line:79% position:20% size:58%
and finally predate
and exploit each other.

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:07.652 align:start line:10% position:18% size:65%
But it's this snowballing
effect of diversity itself

00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:11.623 align:start line:10% position:20% size:58%
that raises arthropods
onto a whole new level.

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:18.496 align:start line:79% position:18% size:65%
The arthropods have lived,
survived,

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:22.700 align:start line:79% position:20% size:60%
and thrived on earth
for 400 million years...

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.569 align:start line:85% position:33% size:33%
[thunderclap]

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
...through extreme
climate change,

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.775 align:start line:85% position:30% size:40%
volcanic events,

00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:33.978 align:start line:85% position:38% size:23%
ice ages,

00:28:33.978 --> 00:28:36.448 align:start line:79% position:28% size:45%
and the extinction
of the dinosaurs.

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:43.221 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
In fact, arthropods
have survived and thrived

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:47.892 align:start line:79% position:18% size:63%
when 99.9% of all species
that ever lived

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:49.694 align:start line:85% position:25% size:50%
have become extinct.
